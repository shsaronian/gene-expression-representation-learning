# gene-expression-representation-learning
Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) is trained on two high-dimensional gene expression datasets, GSE99095 which is a single-cell RNA sequence bone-marrow cells dataset, and GSE106291 which is an RNA sequence gene expression matrix collected from acute leukemia patients under treatment. The SDAE learns hidden low-dimensional representations from both sets, so dimensionality reduction and feature extraction is performed. These features are then fed to a fully-connected DNN, which classifies patients with bone-marrow cancer and seperates them from healthy patients in case of GSE99095, and in GSE106291 it detects if a patient is resistant to treatment or not. The effectiveness of this method for representation learning and feature extraction as a preprocessing step before DNN classification and its accuracy is then compared to Random Forest + DNN (fDNN: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9040841) and also different versions of SVM, on both datasets.
